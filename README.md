# Virtual Genesis

In this project, I hope to take on the book of Genesis from the bible, and recreate it as a videogame in the unreal engine.

## Software Requirements

This project requires Unreal Engine 4

## How to get started
Clone this repository onto your hard drive.

Open it using the Unreal Engine editor by browsing your files for where you installed the clone to. The file to open is

When the level loads, click on the play button to play the game in the editor, or the launch button to play the game as if it were a game installed on your computer.
